[Here's a link](http://tsmacdonald.com/assets/foreign-sonnets.pdf) to a paper I
wrote last December as part of my master's degree. For several years I've been
perplexed by the way 18th-century Scottish musicians handled trying to sound
Scottish, British, or European and my eventual epiphany came when I realised
Scots literature scholars had already done a lot of the thinking for me. This
paper is hardly the end of the matter, but it is a first step in looking at
Scottish music through the same lenses we use for the Scots poetry contemporary
to it.
