Perhaps the first thing I learned in my first ever Scottish fiddle lesson was
the so-called 'arrow stroke' or 'up-driven bow', and as I continued to study it
became clear that there's a very strong tradition, especially among
Northeast-style players, of using it in strathspeys and claiming it was
invented by Niel Gow. There isn't a primary source tying it to Gow, but there
is at least one thing worth mentioning…

Gow's biography, printed in the January, 1809 issue of _The Scots Magazine and
Edinburgh Literary miscellany_ (nearly two years after his death), is likely the
main source for bowing stories about Gow. First it tells of a fiddle competition
that Niel competed in as a teenager, where he won and the blind judge 'said that
he could distinguish _the stroke of Neil's Bow_ among a hundred players'
(emphasis in the original).

Later on we learn about the '_upward_ or returning _stroke_ [which] was Gow's
forte. His bow-hand […] was uncommonly powerful; and when the note produced by
the up-bow was often feeble and indistinct in other hands, it was struck, in his
playing, with a strength and certainty, which never failed to surprize and
delight the skilful hearer.'

# An example: Athole House

The most interesting part is the specific mention of Gow's 'manner of striking
the tenor C, in "Athole House."' Here's the tune as published in the Gows'
_Complete Repository_ and as first published by its composer, Daniel Dow, in
his _Twenty Minuets and Sixteen Reels or Country Dances_.

Assuming the slurs are correct and the C is played up-bow as described, that
means the last bar is played:

</span>

To avoid a very awkward string crossing it makes sense to lift the bow after
the high C, which is supported by the staccato dot on it. That also means the
bow can come down hard on the low C: 'strength and certainty' indeed! The
notated rhythm is also helpful; a little extra time on the high C gives the
player more of a chance to lift the bow, and the low C being a semiquaver
instead of a quaver if anything accents it more. The extra accent (the low C)
introducing the open D is a nice rhythmic effect to end the phrase, and indeed
I think the C-to-D gesture is the point to the whole exercise. It's just not
half as exciting with a weak C; it makes the tune sound a little too square.

The end of the A part isn't quite as neat, but still works fine:

</span>

Mechanically it's quite simlar to the above. I imagine slurring the final two
Fs together is up to the player's discretion in the moment, and I believe the
slurred staccato indication on the semiquavers is _not_ a call for portato, but
rather an indication that it can be played as four slurred notes or two slurred
and two separate notes. Both work nicely.

In general I think the accented up-bow works nicely in all sorts of
places. Earlier in the same volume of the _Repository_ we find Bonny Annie. The
E-G# figure in the last bar of the A part is very reminiscent of the C-C figure
from Athole House (substitute "G#" for "tenor C"). It also lends itself to
having accented up bows used on the Cs that end the first and third bars.

# Terminology?

The modern driven bow refers to a down-up-up-up (_three_ ups) figure, and it's
worth explicitly noting that the Gow examples above use only two ups. Moving
forward by a century, William Honeyman talks about a 'catching of the driven
note' and proposes some schemes to drive the one note generally involving a
two-note slur. It's very similar but not identical to the Gow scheme
above. Skinner's _Guide to Bowing_ does not describe driven notes, but explains
the modern slur-three in great detail and calls it 'the loop'.

I think the glory of writing a blogpost instead of a proper article is that you
can end without a conclusion, so I'll leave it there to be revisited in more
detail later. Happy fiddling!
