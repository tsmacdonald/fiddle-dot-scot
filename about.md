# About

This site hopes to be two things:

1. A collection of useful information about historic and contemporary Scottish fiddling

2. A research blog for Scottish fiddle scholars.

It is maintained (and mostly authored) by [Tim Macdonald](http://www.tsmacdonald.com), a fiddler and a research
student at the University of Edinburgh.
