# About

This site hopes to be two things:

1. A collection of useful information about historic and contemporary Scottish fiddling

2. A research blog for Scottish fiddle scholars.

It is maintained (and most of the content is by) [Tim Macdonald](http://www.tsmacdonald.com), a fiddler and a master's
student at the University of Edinburgh researching historic performance practice in Edinburgh at the end of the long 18th
century.
