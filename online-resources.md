# Other Online Resources

* [**HMS.scot**](https://hms.scot/): Database of many major 18th-century printed tune collections, including the most
  up-to-date notes on the people involved. Includes some digitised collections. Also includes Aaron McGregor's very
  thorough index of early manuscript collections.

* [**Scottish Music Index**](https://scottishmusicindex.org/): Compiled by the late Charlie Gore, a more complete index
  of 18th- and 19th-century printed tune collections than HMS.scot. Unlike HMS.scot, does not include any research notes.
  Requires a subscription (Â£10 for two years).

* [**Tobar an Dualchais / Kist o Riches**](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/): Online access to part of the University
  of Edinburgh's School of Scottish Studies Archives.

* [**rareTunes**](https://raretunes.org/): In its own words, 'A curated audio scrapbook of recordings that range from
  near-studio quality to crowded and noisy house sessions, from digital media to old bits of tape, vinyl and obscure
  78s.' Also includes much supplemental information about Scottish music and musicians, especially in the past 150
  years.

* [**Glen Collection of Printed Music**](https://digital.nls.uk/special-collections-of-printed-music/archive/87729635):
  Partially digitised archive of the National Library of Scotland's Glen Collection.

* [**IMSLP**](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Folk_Songs,_Scottish/Collections): The Wild West of sheet music facsimiles,
  but includes many books of fiddle tunes. They are not always well categorised or easy to find.
