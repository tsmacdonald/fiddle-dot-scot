# Other Online Resources

* [**HMS.scot**](https://hms.scot/): Database of many major 18th-century printed tune collections, including the most
  up-to-date notes on the people involved. Includes some digitized collections. Also includes Aaron McGregor's very
  thorough index of early manuscript collections.

* [**Scottish Music Index**](https://scottishmusicindex.org/): Compiled by the late Charlie Gore, a more complete index
  of 18th and 19th-century printed tune collections than HMS.scot. Unlike HMS.scot, does not include any research notes.
  Requires a subscription (Â£10 for two years).

* [**Tobar an Dualchais / Kist o Riches**](https://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/): Online access to part of the University
  of Edinburgh's School of Scottish Studies Archives.

* [**Glen Collection of Printed Music**](https://digital.nls.uk/special-collections-of-printed-music/archive/87729635)
  Partially digitized archive of the National Library of Scotland's Glen Collection.

* [**IMSLP**](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Folk_Songs,_Scottish/Collections) The Wild West of sheet music facsimiles,
  but includes many books of fiddle tunes. They are not always well categorized or easy to find.
